**What?** An app that reads an iTunes library and creates equivalent playlists in Spotify.
**Why?** I had a situation where I had 2 repositories of music, one in iTunes for music that I had purchased,
  and one in Spotify for streaming. The latest iOS update made the music app look terrible, so I decided to 
  combine the two in Spotify, but I didn't want to recreate playlists containing over 15,000 songs manually.

**How?**
1.  Log in to Spotify using the button below.
2.  Export your iTunes playlists/library in .xml format. File > Library > Export Library.../Export Playlist...
3.  Upload the .xml file (don't worry, it is never stored on the server).
4.  Export the playlist/s to Spotify!
